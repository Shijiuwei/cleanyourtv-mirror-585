# AGENTS.md

Instructions for coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Cursor, Copilot and others) working in
this repository. People should start with [README.md](README.md) and [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md);
this file repeats their rules in the form an agent needs, and links to them for the detail.

## First: which job are you doing?

| You were asked to | Do this |
|---|---|
| Clean up a TV: debloat it, install the launcher, push a theme | Read [PROMPT.md](PROMPT.md) and follow it exactly, on the real TV. Use the tools in `tools/` and the launcher in `launcher/` rather than writing new ones; the only file you need to change is `launcher/app/src/main/res/values/config.xml`, or a theme's `config.json`, for this TV. Do not edit the repo's docs, tests or other code, and do not open issues or pull requests unless the person asks you to. |
| Change this repo: a TV list, a fix, a translation, a theme, docs | Skip the next section and read on from [Repo map](#repo-map). |

### Cleaning a TV: the rules that are not negotiable

[PROMPT.md](PROMPT.md) is the procedure. Its safety rules, in brief:

- **Disable, never uninstall.** `pm disable-user --user 0`, one package per shell call. No
  `pm uninstall`, no root, nothing flashed. Every step must be undone by `tools/restore.sh`.
- **Back up first.** Package list, disabled list, `getprop` and settings into `backup/` before the first
  change. `tools/disable.sh` also writes its own record in `~/.cleanyourtv/`; keep the list you applied.
- **Leave alone what the TV needs to work:** the TV app and input services behind HDMI and the tuner,
  the input/source menu, remote and Bluetooth pairing, the on-screen keyboard, Play Store and Play
  Services. When a package name says nothing, read `dumpsys package <name>`, then ask.
- **Never disable Android's core packages:** the permission controller, package installer, ext
  services/shared and module metadata (`com.android.*` and `com.google.android.*`),
  `com.google.android.overlay.modules*`, `com.android.providers.*` (calendar, contacts, user dictionary
  and blocked numbers aside), `com.android.systemui`, `com.android.shell`, `com.android.phone`,
  `com.android.settings`, `com.android.tv.settings`, `android`. Without them Android may not boot (#884);
  `tools/disable.sh`, `disable.ps1` and `check.py --fix` refuse such a list, with no override.
- **Never start a factory or test package** (`com.cvte.tv.hkcfac`, `mediatek.factorymenu.ui` and the like),
  not even to look. On some boards that flips a factory-mode flag the shell cannot undo.
- **Keep the Home guard.** The stock launcher is disabled only after the new launcher is installed and
  confirmed as Home (`dumpsys activity activities | grep mFocusedApp`). On Google TV, check
  `dumpsys wifi | grep -o 'cname=[^ ]*'` before disabling setupwraith: if it owns the saved Wi-Fi
  network, disabling it takes the TV off Wi-Fi and ADB. `tools/disable.sh` and
  `launcher/build-and-install.sh` already enforce this. Use `FORCE_HOME=1` or `FORCE_SETUPWRAITH=1` only in
  the situation the script's own message describes, and only with the person's agreement.
  - On a CVTE board (any `com.cvte.*` package), leave its stock launcher (`com.cvte.tv.launcher.*`) enabled
    unless the `examples/` folder for that exact board disables it. Make the new launcher Home with
    `cmd package set-home-activity`, reboot once, and confirm Home and ADB come back before anything else.
    Don't enable a remote-key helper in the same pass: a JVC set hung on its boot animation with ADB gone
    after both were done before one reboot (#741).
- **Ask before anything the family uses.** Streaming apps, the voice assistant, Chromecast, Miracast and
  the firmware updater go into one checklist question; disable only what the person does not tick.
- **Disable in small batches** and screenshot between them (`tools/tv.py --screenshot shots/01.png`).
  Live TV, HDMI and some streaming apps give empty screenshots; that is the TV, not damage.
- **An injected key is not proof** for a remote button that goes through an accessibility helper: ask the
  person to press the real button. `am force-stop com.gathin.tvhome` switches those helpers off.
- **Close ADB afterwards.** USB debugging and Network/ADB debugging off, authorisations revoked, reboot,
  then `tools/adb-closed.py <tv ip>` must report the port closed. Port 5555 is plaintext.
- **Stop and say so** when the TV refuses: `pm disable-user` refused for every package, a sideload that
  fails verification, or an SDK below the launcher's `minSdk` 26. Do not retry in a loop, and do not lower
  `minSdk` or hand over an APK built elsewhere.
- **Not an Android TV?** No ADB port at all, or the set identifies as Tizen, webOS, Roku OS, VIDAA or
  SmartCast: stop, nothing here applies. Send the person to https://cleanyour.tv/not-android, which turns
  off the tracking with the remote.

The person's backups (`backup/`), screenshots (`shots/`), notes (`work/`) and the ADB key
(`tools/adbkey/`) are listed in `.gitignore` and must never be committed. If the person wants to
share their TV's list afterwards, follow [`docs/workflows/tv-list.md`](docs/workflows/tv-list.md).

## Repo map

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `PROMPT.md` | The prompt people paste into their agent. Brand-neutral; safety rules live here. |
| `README.md` | Front page, with the TV table (generated from `examples/*/tv.json` by `tools/gen_tables.py`) and the Tools table. `README.zh-CN.md` and `README.vi.md` are translations. |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | The contributor guide for people. "Where does my idea go?" is the routing table. |
| `SECURITY.md` | Private vulnerability reporting. |
| `SHOWCASE.md` | Projects built on this repo that live in their own repositories. |
| `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` | Includes the rule against publishing device identifiers, Wi-Fi names and IPs. |
| `examples/` | One folder per tested TV model: `debloat.txt`, `tv.json` (its row in the TV tables), sometimes a `README.md` and a `config.json`. Indexed in `examples/README.md`, whose table is generated too. |
| `docs/` | `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`, the module-card contract (`docs/modules.md`), `docs/devices/` for models with notes but no tested list, and the [workflows](#workflows). |
| `launcher/` | The reference launcher, package `com.gathin.tvhome`: plain Java, AndroidX RecyclerView and DynamicAnimation, `minSdk` 26, no `INTERNET` permission. |
| `themes/` | One folder per theme: `config.json`, a required `screenshot.jpg`, optional wallpapers. Keys are documented in `themes/README.md`. |
| `addons/` | Optional module-card apps, each its own Gradle project, never built into the launcher. |
| `tools/` | The ADB client (`tv.py`) and the scripts, listed in the README's Tools table. Shell scripts have PowerShell twins. Each script's usage is in its first lines, and the larger ones have a guide beside them (`tools/*.md`): read it before running the script. |
| `tests/` | Python `unittest` suite: list format, README tables, press counts, themes, add-ons, the Home guard and the tools against fake TVs. |
| `.github/workflows/` | `ci.yml` (tests, launcher build, APK size gate), `addons.yml`, `maintainer-bot.yml`. |
| `.github/maintainer/MAINTAINER.md` | The review policy the maintainer and the PR bot apply. |
| `.github/pull_request_template.md` | The PR checklist. Fill it in. |

## Where a change goes

The core stays small on purpose. Pick the smallest home that fits (CONTRIBUTING, "Where does my idea go?"):

| The change | Where it goes |
|---|---|
| A TV list, a fix, a translation, docs, a tool fix | A pull request here |
| A small launcher switch that is off by default | A pull request here: see [`docs/workflows/launcher-switch.md`](docs/workflows/launcher-switch.md) |
| A new look: colours, wallpaper, dock, columns, that existing config keys can carry | `themes/<name>/` |
| A widget or tile that can be its own small app | `addons/<name>/`, as a module card that never touches `launcher/` |
| A whole new launcher, a heavy restyle, a port to another platform, a lower `minSdk`, new permissions or network access, Fire TV Home takeover, a changed default for every TV | Your own repository, plus one row in `SHOWCASE.md` |
| Safety rules in `PROMPT.md`, the Home-safety logic in the scripts, protected packages, CI and workflows, the APK size gate | Open an issue for the maintainer; do not change it in a PR |

Every PR is reviewed by the maintainer and by a bot that apply `.github/maintainer/MAINTAINER.md`: read its
verdicts before a non-trivial PR. Changes to the Home or launch path (Home key, boot, return to Home, the
install scripts) are usually held for a run on a real TV.

## Workflows

Step-by-step methods in `docs/workflows/`. Read the one that fits before you start; each opens with when to
use it and ends with the check to run.

- [`tv-list.md`](docs/workflows/tv-list.md): add a tested TV's debloat list with its `tv.json`, or update one.
- [`launcher-switch.md`](docs/workflows/launcher-switch.md): add an off-by-default launcher switch, within the size gate.
- [`translation.md`](docs/workflows/translation.md): add a launcher language, or fill strings missing from one.
- [`theme.md`](docs/workflows/theme.md): add a theme from existing keys, with its screenshot from a real TV.
- [`addon.md`](docs/workflows/addon.md): add a module-card app that never touches `launcher/`.
- [`showcase.md`](docs/workflows/showcase.md): list a project that lives in its own repository.
- [`press.md`](docs/workflows/press.md): add an article and update the four press counts.
- [`docs-notes.md`](docs/workflows/docs-notes.md): add a troubleshooting entry or a `PROMPT.md` fix, keeping pinned facts.
- [`perf-ab.md`](docs/workflows/perf-ab.md): an optional check of a launcher change for performance regressions with
  `tools/bench.py`, and measure an improvement or a failed check with traces, a report and flame charts.

## Before opening a PR

| Check | Command or rule |
|---|---|
| Tests, as CI runs them | `tools/venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tests -v` after `python3 -m venv tools/venv` and `tools/venv/bin/pip install -r tools/requirements.txt`. On `main`, CI sets `CLEANYOURTV_STRICT=1`, and its "README tables" job checks that the TV tables and counts are what `tools/gen_tables.py` writes. On Windows the suites that drive `tools/*.sh` report as skipped: they need a POSIX shell, and CI runs them. |
| Launcher, if you touched `launcher/` | JDK 17, Android SDK platform 34, build-tools 34.0.0. In `launcher/`: `./gradlew --no-daemon testReleaseUnitTest lintRelease assembleRelease`. Lint must stay at zero errors. |
| APK size gate | `launcher/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk` must be under 589,824 B (576 KB). Linux: `stat -c %s`, macOS: `stat -f %z`. |
| README rows | A new list adds only its folder, with a `tv.json`: the TV tables, the brand line and the counts are generated after merging, so leave them alone. A theme has its row in `themes/README.md`; an add-on in `addons/README.md`. |
| One topic per PR | A TV list never rides inside a launcher feature PR. A device's list plus small fixes for that same device can be one PR. |
| Tested on | Say which TV, Android version and firmware you tested on, in the PR template's "Tested on" line. |
| Real TV | Launcher changes are verified on a real TV, not only the emulator: `tools/tv.py --screenshot shots/after.png DPAD_DOWN`. D-pad from every edge (Up, Down, Left, Right). A button handled by an accessibility helper needs a press on the real remote, and a force-stop of the launcher switches the helpers off (`docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`). |
| Screenshots | Every visual change has a screenshot from the TV in the PR description. |
| Performance | A performance claim shows `tools/bench.py` before and after, plus trace numbers. For any other launcher change the regression check in [`docs/workflows/perf-ab.md`](docs/workflows/perf-ab.md) is optional but welcome. |
| Stray files | No files that nothing links to: screenshots belong in the PR description, not the tree. |

## Hard rules

Never do these in a PR:

- **No prebuilt APKs or binaries** in the repo, not even as CI artifacts. People build from source.
- **No uninstalling.** No `pm uninstall` in a list or a script. `pm hide` or `pm block` only with the matching
  undo written in the list header.
- **No network in the launcher:** no `INTERNET` permission, no network features, no analytics or telemetry, no
  background services or polling, no blur or video. It targets TVs with 1 GB of RAM.
- **No new launcher dependencies** without discussing them in an issue first.
- **No changes to the safety rules** in `PROMPT.md`, the Home guard and other safety checks in
  `tools/disable.sh`, `tools/check.py` and `launcher/build-and-install.sh`, or the list of packages the TV
  needs, without the maintainer.
- **No changing a default for every TV.** New behaviour is off until a theme or `config.xml` turns it on.
- **Firmware updaters are better left enabled** (commented out in the list); a list that disables one says
  why in its header.
- **No Private DNS or AdGuard setup, and no install or restore scripts, inside a list folder.** The README
  already has the optional DNS extra; a note that Private DNS works on that TV is fine.
- **No secrets or identifiers** in commits, lists or screenshots: no IP addresses, Wi-Fi names, account emails,
  serial numbers, Android IDs, MAC addresses or ADB keys. Use `<tv ip>` or `192.168.1.50` in docs.
- **Don't edit `.github/workflows/`** or the APK size gate in a normal PR. A PR whose main content is a new CI
  workflow that builds or publishes releases is closed.
- **No root, no getting around app-store protection, no private builds** others cannot reproduce from this repo.
- **No extras added to the PROMPT flow** beyond debloating and the launcher.
- **Don't relax `minSdk`** (26) or the launcher's permissions; those are forks for `SHOWCASE.md`.
- **Blur or crop** Wi-Fi names, people's names and cities (the top bar, a theme's `greeting_name`) before a
  screenshot goes anywhere public. No TV Settings screenshots that show accounts, emails or device names.
  From `tools/tv.py --probe`, `getprop` and backups, quote only the model, Android version and firmware build.
- **Security problems are reported privately**, as [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) describes, never in a public issue.

## Commit and PR style

- Titles are `area: what changed`, in plain words, with the issue in parentheses when there is one:
  `examples: add Epson LS800 laser projector (Askey HA90, Amlogic), Android TV 14`,
  `docs: an HDMI row opens any app that claims the channel MIME type (#805)`,
  `Launcher: show_inputs_pill, to hide the Inputs pill`. The area is the folder or file the change is in:
  `examples`, `Launcher`, `docs`, `tools`, `tests`, `themes`, `addons`, `SHOWCASE`, `README`, `Press`.
- The body is one or two sentences on what changed and the TV it was tried on, then the template's checklist.
  `Fixes #N` or `Closes #N` when it resolves an issue.
- One topic per PR. Small is fine. Be kind in reviews.
- Contributions are released under the repo's MIT licence.

## Where to ask

Questions go to [GitHub Discussions](https://fbkt.tcti.cn/wangluo/affordable-41880577.html); bugs, TV lists and
ideas that need a launcher change or a new dependency go to an issue first, with the templates in
`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`.
